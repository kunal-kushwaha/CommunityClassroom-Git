This tutorial will help you with using Git & GitHub for your personal projects and contributing to Open Source, with no prerequisites, in an easy to understand language.

It starts from the very basics of Git & GitHub, covering all the essential commands, including concepts such as branching, pull requests, forking, etc. We also cover other concepts such as squashing, resolving merge conflicts, keeping your code in sync, and more.

NOTE:
- Windows users can use git bash, all the commands will work.
- When using git for the first time, set the global configs using the commands:
$ git config --global user.name "your_name"
$ git config --global user.email your_email
